## About

This repository merges the two halves of a personal server-repack project into one place:

- **`server/`** — a from-scratch game server for Ark Order, written in plain Node.js
  (standard library only, no npm dependencies). It implements the game protocol end to
  end: accounts and per-account saves, battle, gacha, guild, dorm, activities, shop,
  tower, dream realm, achievements, and dozens of other systems.
- **`client/`** — the client patch layer. The game client runs Lua locally, so the
  patches are shipped as plaintext Lua files (network core with runtime hooks, patched
  config tables, a handful of module fixes). At build time they are overlaid onto the
  original game bytecode; at runtime the patched tree is served to the client by the
  server itself.
- **`build/`** — the Android repack pipeline: asset preparation, standalone-server APK
  packaging and signing, data APK packaging, manifest permission surgery, icon/logo
  pipeline, and the C# boot host that runs the server on-device.
- **`gates/`** — the factory quality gates that run inside the build before a package
  ships (frame size audit, Lua export-surface diff, asset reference audits, public-IP
  scan, post-package permission/verification suite).

## Repository layout

| Path | Contents |
|---|---|
| `server/` | Game server: entry points (`start.js`, `game_server.js`), protocol layer (`proto.js`, `etf.js`, `lib.js`), 39 protocol handlers (`handlers/`), 72 runtime data tables (`data/`), per-account saves (`accounts.js`, `save_admin.js`), HTTP router and admin endpoints |
| `client/` | 29 plaintext Lua patch files, stored with the same relative paths as the generated remote tree they are overlaid onto |
| `build/` | `make.py` (single build entry), APK packaging/signing scripts, `pslocal/` (C# boot host, asset preparation, babel ES5 transpile, node binary rebuild), `data_apk/` (data pack tool), `save_manager/` and `gateprobe/` (companion APK sources) |
| `gates/` | Factory quality gates wired into `make.py` |
| `tools/` | Small runtime-required reference data: protocol key tables (`key_lua/`), CfgItems/CfgSkillDetail/CfgMain extracts, vendored LuaJIT decompiler (`ljd/`, GPL-3.0) |
| `client/` + `tools/lua_remote/` | The remote Lua tree (`tools/lua_remote/{bc,src}`) is **generated at build time** by `build/client_assembly.py` from your local game asset bundles; only the patch overlay (`client/`) is tracked |

## Requirements

**Running the server** (PC or packaged on-device):

- Node.js ≥ 16 — no npm install required, everything is standard library.

**Building the APK** additionally needs machine-local inputs that are **not** part of
this repository (see `.gitignore` — none of them are distributable):

- The base game APK and unpacked game tree (`tools/fzzl_lua_signed.apk`, `fzzl/`)
- The game's `res/luascript/*.ab` asset bundles (for `client_assembly.py`)
- A signing keystore (`tools/fzzl.keystore`) and the `FZZL_KS_PASS` environment variable
- .NET SDK (local copy expected at `tools/dotnetsdk/`), Android build-tools 36.1.0 +
  platform android-35
- Pillow (Python) for the icon pipeline; the icon source image is configured via
  `FZZL_ICON_SRC`
- Paths default to historical machine-local conventions and can be overridden via
  `FZZL_LUA_AB_DIR` / `FZZL_BASE_APK` environment variables.

## Quick start (server)

```
node server/start.js
```

- HTTP endpoints on `:8081`, game protocol on `:9021`, Lua remote frame on `:44587`.
- Accounts live in `server/accounts.json`, per-account saves in `server/saves/`
  (runtime files, never committed). A fresh start bootstraps a default account.
- Point the game client at this host to log in.

## Building the APK

```
python build/make.py            # full pipeline: client assembly + gates + package + sign
python build/make.py --dry-run  # preflight only
```

`make.py` runs, in order: client Lua tree assembly (⓪), asset preparation + seeding
fingerprint (①), the factory gates (①b–①i: frame size, Lua export surface, feature ids,
desc-AOE, shop type ids, grantGoods conn, public-IP scan, tower enemy types), the boot
host compile (②), icon generation (②c), packaging + signing (③), and the post-package
permission audit (④). Every gate is fail-fast: the build refuses to produce a package
that would break at runtime.
